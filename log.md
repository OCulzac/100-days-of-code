# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 14, 2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Setup time and scheduling tools, Trello and PomoDoneApp.

**Thoughts:** Startin off this journey again. The last time a mixture of poor planning and life got in the way so hopefully this time around it all goes better.
