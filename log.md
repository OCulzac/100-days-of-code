**Today's Progress**: Setup time and scheduling tools, Trello and PomoDoneApp.

**Thoughts:** Startin off this journey again. The last time a mixture of poor planning and life got in the way so hopefully this time around it all goes better.

**Thoughts:**

***1.*** This project really deepened my understanding of flexbox. I still need more practice but I'm getting better.

***2.*** Still having issues creating a navbar and working with positioning. It'll be a long day tomorrow to get this to work. Looking forward to it :)
